## 🧠 WHO AM I

🧩 Engineering sophomore obsessed with **how things actually work**  
🔩 I operate close to silicon and system level, timing paths and architectural bottlenecks  

---

## 💣 CORE DOMAINS

### 🖥️ COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE
- Branch prediction internals
- Cache behavior and replacement logic
- Pipeline-level reasoning
- Performance vs hardware cost tradeoffs

### ⚙️ HARDWARE–ML CO-DESIGN
- ML models constrained by latency and area
- Online learning on real hardware
- Accuracy is useless without feasibility

### 🔌 FPGA & EMBEDDED SYSTEMS
- RTL design (Verilog)
- Timing-aware design decisions
- Sensor → hardware → inference pipelines
- Prototyping ideas that don’t hide behind simulators

## ⚠️ DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

🔥 Hardware constraints come first  
🔥 Latency > Accuracy  
🔥 Area matters  
🔥 Power matters  

---

## 🎯 CURRENT DIRECTION

⚡ Deepening architecture-level ML understanding  
⚡ Translating research ideas into RTL  
⚡ Long-term: systems research

---

## 🧨 ENERGY CHECK

💀 I don’t optimize dashboards  
💀 I don’t chase trends  
💀 I don’t build toy systems  

I build **mechanisms**, **pipelines**, and **hardware-feasible intelligence**.
